Static Testing

Static testing catches faults early in a lifecycle

Static testing does not require the system to run, Dynamic testing does.

It's cheaper to remove defects found early, production defects can be costly

test objectives:
- Asses quality
- Identify defects
Static and Dynamic are complementary
- each finding different defects

Dynamic testing requires:
- Test conditions identified,
- then written
- Test data sourced
- test environment obtained
- run test against the code
- observe and report failures

Static testing requires:
- Code does not have to be run
- Defects are found in the work products
- dormant defects can be identified
- - defect on rare path or obscure condition

Defects in designed
- Ineffective algorithms
- ineffective database structures
- High coupling, low cohesion

It's easy to review small pieces of code but Static testing can work quickly across large amounts of code.

The Review process

The process:
- Planning
- Initiation
- preparation
- issue communication
- addressing, fixing, reporting

Reviews catch defect migration by identifying issues early

What is an issue:
- potential defect
- Recommendation (reviewer suggest a different method)
- Question (reviewer is confused how a thing works)

Formal review
- TEam participation
- Documented Results
- Documented procedures
Informal Review
- No defined process
no formal document output

Review types:
- Informal review
- - detects potential defects and/or explores new ideas informally between few developers
- Walk through
- - led by author of te work product, to find defects and alt implementations. varies in formality.
- Technical review
- - Formal review including technical experts to find potential defects and find consensus
- Inspection
- - A very formal process where the team are given specific jobs to find potential defects, build confidence and prevent future defects through root cause analysis

How to plan a review

~30% of the review

Define the scope
- what is the purpose
- what is to be reviewed
- identify quality characteristics

Review characteristics
- Review type
- activities
- assigned roles to the team members
- checklist for the review

Review leader selects the members of the review
- choose a mixture of skills and experience

Estimate effort and timeframe
- size of document vs time allowed to check it
- checking rate, how much time per page.

Entry and exit criteria
- what is needed to start (document formatting, people available etc.)
- what criteria must be met to approve the work

Initiate the review
- face to face workshop
- virtual meeting
- a email might be enough
- distribute the work product
- leader explains the scope, objective, process, allocates roles, gives an overview
- conclude the session with a Q&A

---------------------------------

How to run a review

A review leader may initiate a meeting to communicate issues
- potential defects
- recommendations
- answers questions
- Avoid discussion of possible solutions
- - instead keep the team focused defects and assign ownership and status to them.

Quality characteristics
- Evaluate issues raised
- document the findings

At end of review the team makes a decision vs exit criteria
- Accept the product as is
- accept with minor changes
- reject for another review with major changes,

Fixing and reporting
- create defect report
- author fixes defect
- leader informs informs related personnel
- update defect status
- gathering metrics
- check exit criteria
- accept work product

---------------------------------

Roles and responsibilities

Author
- creates the work product
- address the issue, fixing defects
- answers questions at the review meeting

Leader
- Takes responsibility of the review
- organises who will be involved

Facilitator
- organises meeting and makes sure they start on time and end timely
- Also mediates the review to keep it productive

Reviewer
- Technical expert or key member of staff or business expert
- brings their insight to the review

Scribe
- collated issue during the review
- takes written form/notes
- keeps track of defects open points and decisions of the meeting

Management
- responsible for review planning within the organisation
- decides review strategy
- assigned budget and time
- monitors cost effectiveness
- Executes control decisions
