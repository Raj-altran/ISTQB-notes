Static Testing

Static testing catches faults early in a lifecycle

Static testing does not require the system to run, Dynamic testing does.

It's cheaper to remove defects found early, production defects can be costly

test objectives:
- Asses quality
- Identify defects
Static and Dynamic are complementary
- each finding different defects

Dynamic testing requires:
- Test conditions identified,
- then written
- Test data sourced
- test environment obtained
- run test against the code
- observe and report failures

Static testing requires:
- Code does not have to be run
- Defects are found in the work products
- dormant defects can be identified
- - defect on rare path or obscure condition

Defects in designed
- Ineffective algorithms
- ineffective database structures
- High coupling, low cohesion

It's easy to review small pieces of code but Static testing can work quickly across large amounts of code.

The Review process

The process:
- Planning
- Initiation
- preparation
- issue communication
- addressing, fixing, reporting

Reviews catch defect migration by identifying issues early

What is an issue:
- potential defect
- Recommendation (reviewer suggest a different method)
- Question (reviewer is confused how a thing works)

Formal review
- TEam participation
- Documented Results
- Documented procedures
Informal Review
- No defined process
no formal document output

Review types:
- Informal review
- - detects potential defects and/or explores new ideas informally between few developers
- Walk through
- - led by author of te work product, to find defects and alt implementations. varies in formality.
- Technical review
- - Formal review including technical experts to find potential defects and find consensus
- Inspection
- - A very formal process where the team are given specific jobs to find potential defects, build confidence and prevent future defects through root cause analysis

How to plan a review

~30% of the review

Define the scope
- what is the purpose
- what is to be reviewed
- identify quality characteristics

Review characteristics
- Review type
- activities
- assigned roles to the team members
- checklist for the review

Review leader selects the members of the review
- choose a mixture of skills and experience

Estimate effort and timeframe
- size of document vs time allowed to check it
- checking rate, how much time per page.

Entry and exit criteria
- what is needed to start (document formatting, people available etc.)
- what criteria must be met to approve the work

Initiate the review
- face to face workshop
- virtual meeting
- a email might be enough
- distribute the work product
- leader explains the scope, objective, process, allocates roles, gives an overview
- conclude the session with a Q&A

---------------------------------

How to run a review

A review leader may initiate a meeting to communicate issues
- potential defects
- recommendations
- answers questions
- Avoid discussion of possible solutions
- - instead keep the team focused defects and assign ownership and status to them.

Quality characteristics
- Evaluate issues raised
- document the findings

At end of review the team makes a decision vs exit criteria
- Accept the product as is
- accept with minor changes
- reject for another review with major changes,

Fixing and reporting
- create defect report
- author fixes defect
- leader informs informs related personnel
- update defect status
- gathering metrics
- check exit criteria
- accept work product

---------------------------------

Roles and responsibilities

Author
- creates the work product
- address the issue, fixing defects
- answers questions at the review meeting

Leader
- Takes responsibility of the review
- organises who will be involved

Facilitator
- organises meeting and makes sure they start on time and end timely
- Also mediates the review to keep it productive

Reviewer
- Technical expert or key member of staff or business expert
- brings their insight to the review

Scribe
- collated issue during the review
- takes written form/notes
- keeps track of defects open points and decisions of the meeting

Management
- responsible for review planning within the organisation
- decides review strategy
- assigned budget and time
- monitors cost effectiveness
- Executes control decisions

Review types compared

4 basic types:
- Informal review
- Walk through
- Technical review
- Inspection


Informal review
- common for agile models
- Clarify user stories, confirm the details to leave no uncertainty.
- purpose - detect defects, generate ideas
- people - buddy developers
- process- no formal structure
- post-review - limited document (posit or story card)

Walk though
- Author prepares presentation
- Aim it t find defects, improve product
- Presentation made by author, minimal prep on viewers side
- exchange ideas about techniques and style
- large audience provides diverse viewpoints
- - low chance of defect being missed.
- May be boring for some and too fast for others
- questions and clarification only

Technical reviews
- main purpose: gain consensus, find defects
- generate new ideas, futures implementations
- 6 to 8 people, technical peers of the leader
- process:
- - Planning, initiation, individual review, issue communications, fixing & reporting

- process: formal, meeting optional
- Post-review: fixing and reporting

Inspection
- follows a well-defined process
- Leader selects the team members, each with specific roles
- an entry criteria is made. A checklist is made to make sure the criteria is followed
- Leader sets a checking rate so that optimal time use for defect finding
- each member focuses on their role
- meeting is run by a facilitator, not the author,
- meeting is spent logging defects and issues at a constant rate
- - no time spent on solutions
- root cause analysis is applied to prevent future issues
- post  meeting, metrics are logged: checking rates, logging rates, remaining defects per page.
- leader checks the exit criteria:
- - the review is complete
- - complete with minor corrections
- - needs a new review with major corrections

Review type     Prep req.   meeting     Author led  Metrics
----------------------------------------------------------------
Informal        no          no          yes         no
Walk though     no          yes         yes         no
Technical       yes         optional    no          some
Inspection      yes         yes         no          yes

Applying the Review process

Review the product not the person

Organizational success factors
- have a clear objective
- choose appropriate review techniques
- select suitable review techniques
- have large documents reviewed in chunks
- adequate notice, allow time to prepare
- management support
- involve the right people for the review
- value the testers as reviewers
- attention to detail
- keep concentration, review in small chunks
- knowledge defects, don't take it personally
- manage meeting well
- create an atmosphere of trust
- training is essential
- senior management should promote a culture of learning and continuous process improvement

The review techniques
- Ad-hoc
- Checklist based
- Scenario/dry runs
- Role based
- perspective-based

Ad-Hoc
- minimal prep
- relays on reviewers expertise
- no guidance given
- work product read sequentially
- duplicate issues are common

Checklist based
- leader creates a checklist based on historic defects
- systematic method
- checklists distributed at initiation
- typical defects are covered
- look outside the checklist
- offers advice to reviewers
- come in question format
- derived from the (inspection) rules
- ideally one checklist per work product
- checklists must be updated
- - new defects found
- - old defects become non-issues
- checklist is usually one page in length

Scenario based
- structures guidelines on reading
- supports "Dry runs"
- better guidelines than simple checklist
- don't be contained to the documented scenarios

Role based
- evaluated from individual stake holder roles
- role could be experienced user, novice user, devs, testers, tec.

Perspective based reading
- no specific procedure, it's based on the tailored procedures chosen for each perspective.
- similar to role based review, reviews take stakeholder roles
- attempts to use the work product
- this give more depths
- less reliance on individual expert
- designer role aims for high system design, tester builds test plans etc.
- PBR provides concrete instructions to help uncover defects
- helps collect knowledge about best practices to help review.
