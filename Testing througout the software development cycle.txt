Testing througout the software development cycle.

ISTQB

international software testing qualifications board

---------------------

SDLC - Software development life cycle.
- a systamatic plan for the project
- smooth progress
- lower cost

A model that describes the type of activity performed at each stage in the software development project, and how the activities relate to one anouther logically and chronologically

Two types of models
- sequental
- Iterative

stages
- Analysis
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

Iterative works on a basis of short term "time cycles" i.e. what can we do in the nex 2 weeks.

Models are simplications of reality
Iterative is not better than iterative
Different models can be mixed e.g. front end and back end are done differently

---------------------

Test Levels - testing small units to testing the whole

Componant testing - testing the smallest units
intergration testing - tesing units added gradualty to each other
system testing - testing the whoole through an interface
Acceptanct testing - given to the end user to see if it meets thier criteria


---------------------

Comparing Test Types - group of test activities aimed at specific characteristics of the system

Functional
- tests functionallity
- does it work as expected
- does the unit/intergratio/system/UI work as expected
- Coverage is the degree which an application is tested as a percent
- - How many of your tests work as a percent
- - Coverage gap - The number of tests/features not passed testing/no testing exists
Non-functional
- Answers the How fast/secure/easy to use the functions are to use

Black-box
- don't know about the internals of the software, just the requiremnt documentation.
- varify iinput and output of the box in various ennviroments
- performance test als can be done by timing input/outputs

White-box
- Testing a box/systme while also knowing the internal workings.
- like black box but often by the dev

Change related testing
- confermation testing check to see if a bugfix works as intended in it's specific area
- Regression is a bug that occues due to a bug fix
- regression testing checks th system for regressions
- Test automations allow tests to be run and rerun at fast speeds to check a whole system.
- Bugfix, new feature, changing existing feature, change in config or enviroment all can create regressions.

-------------------------------

- a test may be a combination of above terms eg. black-box funtional confirmation testing
- All are applicable but focus on the one that matters most for the context.
